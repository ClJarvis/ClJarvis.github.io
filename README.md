##Portfolio Page

A basic portfolio page for showing the projects I have built while a Student at Nashville Software School. Some projects are class directed others are independent projects.
These projects were built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, Jade, and Json.

This is an early version of my portfolio made during the front end course. It is being replaced and will not be updated.
